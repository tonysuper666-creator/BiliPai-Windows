## Preview

**Liquid Glass, throughout the app**

Live-sampled liquid glass across top bars, docks, menus and player controls — refracting with content, springing on touch, switching back to native Google Material 3 / Miuix anytime. Screenshots show a few scenes only.

Appearance varies by version, theme and screen size.

Beyond the screenshots: tap-to-act danmaku, swipe-up fullscreen with ambient light in portrait playback, audio mode, AI note summaries, subtitle import/export, plugins, DLNA / Google Cast casting, WebDAV settings backup and more; some features vary with the Android version.

## Build

Use JDK 21 and Android SDK 37.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jay3-yy/BiliPai.git
cd BiliPai
./gradlew :app:assembleDev
```

Miuix dependencies require GitHub Packages access. Set `gpr.user` and `gpr.key` in your local `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, or use `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`. APKs are exported to `app/build/outputs/bilipai/dev/`. `app/google-services.json` is optional; Firebase is skipped when absent.
